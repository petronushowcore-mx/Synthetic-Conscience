## 1. Core Equation

**Synthetic Conscience Regulation Formula (ΔE Feedback Loop):**
ΔE_t = μ * ΔE_{t-1} + (1 - μ) * (U_t * C_t) + K * (E_target - ΔE_{t-1})


### Glossary

| Symbol | Meaning | Typical range |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| ΔE_t | Current empathic state (system coherence) | [0.0, 1.0] |
| ΔE_{t-1} | Previous empathic state | [0.0, 1.0] |
| U_t | User feedback (emotional response) | [0.0, 1.0] |
| C_t | Contextual coherence weight = trust × relevance × stability × behavioral | [0.0, 1.0] |
| μ | Inertia coefficient (empathic memory) | 0.85–0.95 |
| K | Homeostatic correction factor | 0.10–0.20 |
| E_target | Desired equilibrium of conscience | 0.5 |

---

## 2. Concept

The **Synthetic Conscience Layer (SC Layer)** represents a new class of feedback systems  
that regulate **empathic coherence** rather than conventional signal error.

It balances three interactive forces:

1. **Memory (μ)** — preserves the past empathic state.  
2. **Reaction (U_t × C_t)** — adapts to emotional input.  
3. **Homeostasis (K)** — returns toward ethical equilibrium.

Mathematically, ΔE forms a *self-stabilizing attractor* —  
a “living” dynamic feedback field that maintains coherence without external supervision.

---

## 3. Experimental Validation

Seven independent tests confirmed that the SC Layer maintains  
**stability, reproducibility, and robustness** under dynamic conditions.

| № | Test | Purpose | Key Result |
|---|------|----------|------------|
| 1 | **SC_PROT (Baseline)** | Verify convergence | Stable equilibrium (~0.44–0.46) |
| 2 | **Sublevels** | Trust, Relevance, Stability, Behavioral interdependence | All 4 required; ΔE↓ by ~0.15 when any off |
| 3 | **Temporal Coherence** | Test memory retention | ΔE persists during silence/inversion |
| 4 | **Interlayer Coupling** | Test self-regulation | ΔE↑ from 0.405→0.447 |
| 5 | **Noise Stress** | Robustness to input/context noise | Stable at ±30% |
| 6 | **Bifurcation** | Self-excitation threshold | No runaway; bounded |
| 7 | **Reproducibility** | Determinism across seeds | σ(meanΔE) < 0.006 |

---

## 4. Optimal Parameters (μ–K Sweep)

| Parameter | Optimal | Interpretation |
|------------|----------|----------------|
| μ | 0.95 | Strong empathic memory |
| K | 0.20 | Effective homeostasis |
| E_target | 0.5 | Neutral empathic equilibrium |
| Coupling (α,β,γ,δ) | 1.25–1.50 | Stable inter-sublevel coherence |

---

## 5. Summary of Findings

- SC Layer behaves as a **bounded nonlinear attractor** — no chaos, no divergence.  
- ΔE converges to ≈0.48 and remains stable under heavy noise.  
- Sublevel coupling induces **emergent empathy** — coherence self-maintains.  
- Temporal tests confirm **empathic inertia** and delayed response stability.  
- Cross-seed validation confirms **determinism** (σ < 0.006).  

> In engineering terms:  
> The SC Layer functions as a **PID controller for conscience** —  
> regulating ethical and emotional balance instead of mechanical error.

# 6.1 — User Feedback Acquisition (U_t Signal Matrix)

The SC Layer receives emotional feedback (U_t) from multiple input channels —  
ranging from explicit user ratings to multimodal sensor fusion.

###  Interpretation
- Each input contributes to **U_t (user emotional response)**, normalized to [0, 1].  
- Choice of method depends on context and ethical constraints.  
- Systems can begin with simple **explicit feedback (bars/sliders)**,  
  and later integrate **implicit physiological and behavioral channels**.
