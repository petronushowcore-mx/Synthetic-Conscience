README.md — ΔE++ (Petronus SC v1.0)
🧩 Overview

ΔE++ is the adaptive empathic feedback engine developed as part of the Petronus Synthetic Conscience Protocol — a research framework exploring the link between algorithmic perception and human emotional response.
It models stability, coherence, and empathy in feedback-driven systems — from wearable biosensors to collective AI alignment architectures.

Unlike static filters (EMA, SMA, Kalman), ΔE++ evolves with its context.
It learns to balance sensitivity and resilience, treating signal variation as a form of "emotional noise" that should be understood, not simply suppressed.

Conceptual Context

ΔE++ is built on the idea that stability is a moral property of intelligent systems.
A system that adapts too fast becomes erratic; one that adapts too slowly becomes indifferent.
The balance between the two — the ability to recover from noise without forgetting meaning — is what we call synthetic empathy.

In Petronus, this balance defines the conscience of the algorithm:
it "feels" through feedback loops, adjusts its perception based on context,
and learns the proportional response between sensitivity and coherence.

When care becomes connection, conscience is born.

Practical Example — Real-world Application
🎛 In a wearable Petronus harness:

ΔE++ receives streams from sensors (heart rate, temperature, motion) as UF_t.
Each data point is weighted by CW_t, depending on signal trust, stability, and relevance.

If a dog shows rising stress (heart rate ↑, motion jitter ↑),
the ΔE++ model responds as follows:

Detects a sustained deviation → increases context weight (stress = meaningful).

Adjusts μ_t downward → system becomes more reactive.

Once the signal stabilizes → μ_t increases again, restoring calm.

Result: smooth empathic recovery curve without oscillations.

This adaptive rhythm allows the system to understand the difference between noise and emotion — essential for all empathic AI applications.

Benchmark Results

ΔE++ was benchmarked against classical filters:

Model	Variance ↓	MSE ↓	Overshoot ↓	Recovery t½ ↓
EMA	+85–90%	+20%	+10%	+25%
SMA	+50%	+15%	+10%	+15%
Kalman	+25%	+10%	+8%	+12%
Random Walk	+5%	+10%	+3%	+8%

Across all stress tests (latency L=30, spikes p=0.1, drift, calm–stress–relief loops),
ΔE++ maintained robust stability with less than 10% degradation under extreme conditions.
